# Fibonacci
Compute the nth fibonacci number.

## Exercise
* Design and implement a method to compute the nth fibonacci number in the series starting with 0.
* Fibonacci series starting with 0 looks like this: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 ...
* The next number in the series is the sum of the previous two numbers in the series.
* For example:
   - The 0th fibonacci number is 0
   - The 1st fibonacci number is 1
   - The 6th fibonacci number is 8
